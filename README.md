JD Parser - FastNext

JD Parser aims to extract and correlate relavant information from 
a job description into a JSON which can be processed by the FastNext
AI Matching Engine.

The core of the challenge lies in extracting information from semi-
structured and free text. This is a standard problem that has been
intriguing computer scientists for decades with rapid advancement in
recent years, thanks to cheap computational power and massive free data.
We aim to solve this problem for the specific case of a JD, which should
be a lot easier, given that the structure of JDs are somewhat predictable.
